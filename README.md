# MAGNETORHEOLOGICAL-MR-FLUID-ACTUATORS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

Magnetorheological (MR) Fluid Actuators Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize Magnetorheological (MR) fluid actuators. MR fluids are smart materials whose mechanical properties can be controlled by applying a magnetic field. This repository explores the application of ML, data extraction, interpolation, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict MR fluid actuator features. The goal is to improve their performance and efficiency, ultimately achieving better results compared to physical testing.

Features
Data Extraction: The project includes tools for extracting relevant data from experimental graphs and images, allowing for efficient data processing.

Interpolation: Interpolation techniques are used to create continuous datasets from discrete experimental data points.

Machine Learning Contours: ML techniques are employed to define contours in the data, facilitating feature prediction.

Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR is implemented to predict the features of MR fluid actuators based on the extracted and interpolated data.

Simulink Integration: The SVR model is integrated with Simulink, enabling a direct comparison between the model's predictions and physical testing results.
